## A Letter From the Editor

Dear reader,

  Sometimes when I sit in front of a computer screen, whether I’m doing homework, playing video games, watching movies, or writing this letter, I lose my train of thought and begin to imagine what I would be doing this very moment if computers didn’t exist, which is a glorified way of saying I got distracted. I would still be writing this very same letter, of course, but perhaps in pencil and paper, and I’d conveniently left my eraser in a corner somewhere on my desk. I’d write and rewrite until my fingers cramp, which is a feeling I haven’t felt in a long while. What was it like back then? Ten or twenty years ago when Gradescope and Canvas didn’t exist, and all of my work was graded with a red pen.
  
  I remember back then among my friends, the epitome of technology was an Ipod or a Nintendo DS. There would always be one kid sitting in the back of the bus who would randomly whip out a NDS and immediately become the center of attention. Nobody had phones, and at most I had an old mp3 player with 128 megabytes of storage that I loaded to the brim with Backstreet Boys and Michael Jackson. Toy figures and trading cards were all the rage, and I remember myself being quite decent at origami. After school I would run off to the card shop next to school and play Magic the Gathering until I came home late and missed dinner. In second grade, my mom bought an expensive laptop that was the latest model, and was probably the thickness and weight of three Macbooks stacked on top of each other. She was the coolest mom on Earth for quite a while. 
  
  Those were the simpler times, but not necessarily the better times. Whether we like to admit it or not, the rapid development of technology over the past decade or so has made life a lot easier in every aspect. With a few taps of the finger on a screen, I could achieve what could have taken me hours to do otherwise. Technology makes life simple; it’s hard to argue against fact. It is important to realize that, however, the toll this very technology has taken on us. Most of the newer generation are entitled to this new age of information, and for good reason, but coming from Gen Z, we’ve witnessed the most change in technology and are a lot more aware, which takes me back to my wandering thoughts mentioned earlier. What indeed would I do if computers didn’t exist? In a way, all of us are cripples, clutching on a screen.
  
  I remember in high school, I went to a summer camp in the mountains of San Francisco where campers weren’t allowed to bring any electronics for three weeks.My first few days were spent being distracted by the emptiness in my pocket and the urge to watch youtube before bed, but I got used to the void of screens and earbuds, those three weeks were the most liberating time of my life I’ve ever spent. See, we’re not some angry syndicates trying to burn every phone and computer we come across. We just want to remind you that technology doesn’t complete you, and don’t limit your potential behind a screen. 

Peace and love,
Editor
